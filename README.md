# Memories
full stack MERN app to better practice and understand how to work with MERN technologies to come up with a fully fledged web application

#THE REPO
contains two folders, the client and the server folder each with a package.json file, run npm install for each of the file

I did this project to better understand and grasp the concepts behind the MERN stack, please feel free to criticize constructively.
